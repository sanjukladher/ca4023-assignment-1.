# Analysis  Part3

- I select first random  5 sentences from a test set with positive class and  5 from negative class and do calculation by add one method for each sample document and 

- Calcluate its positive and negative class probabilities by avoiding those words which is not in Vocabulary and to predict what sample documents belong to.

- I achieve 80% accuracy

accuracy = (correct predicted labels) / True labels

- I also select 10 more randomly samples in which i did not balance the classes which can be vary from ratio  6:4  or  7:3  or  5:5

- I achieve same 80 % accuracy in this method as well.

I did these analysis in the notebook, I cannot add a screenshot or table with calculations but it is in the notebook.
